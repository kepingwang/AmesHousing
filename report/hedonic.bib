abstract = "Determinants of house prices in Turkey are examined in this paper using the 2004 Household Budget Survey Data. In property valuation and housing market research, the locational value is usually analyzed by hedonic methods that use multiple regression techniques on large data sets and require a formality based on microeconomic theory in the analyses. Because of potential non-linearity in the hedonic functions, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed in this study as an alternative method. By comparing the prediction performance between the hedonic regression and artificial neural network models, this study demonstrates that \{ANN\} can be a better alternative for prediction of the house prices in Turkey.

  abstract = {Many economists have estimated hedonic price functions for red and white wine. However, estimating a single hedonic price function imposes the assumption that the implicit prices of the attributes are the same for any red or white wine. We argue that even within these two categories, wines are differentiated, and disregarding this heterogeneity causes an aggregation bias in the estimated implicit prices. By estimating hedonic functions specific to price ranges, we show that the wine market is segmented into several product classes or market segments. We find that a model accounting for the existence of wine classes has greater ability to explain the variability in the data and produces more accurate and interpretable results regarding the implicit prices of the attributes.}
